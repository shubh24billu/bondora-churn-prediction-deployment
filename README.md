Predicting defaulters for peer-2-peer lending company Bondora. This dataset has been retrieved from a publicly available data set of a leading European P2P lending platform, Bondora (https://www.bondora.com/en). The retrieved data is a pool of both defaulted and non-defaulted loans from the time period between 1st March 2009 and 27th January 2020.

The main purposes of this analysis are to summarize the characteristics of variables that can affect the loan status and to get some ideas about the relationships among variables.
